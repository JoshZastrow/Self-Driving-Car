# Self-Driving-Car

Hello there. 

This is a personal repository of mini-projects I've worked on (/am working on) related to computer vision and autonomous vehicles. Feel free to poke around. My main focus here is to build up the skills necessary for a career in the self driving car space, or bring my own invention to this space.

### Current Project (As of 4/24/2017)
Finding Lane Lines in Road Images
